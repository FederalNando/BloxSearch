Search through the game servers for a player!


BloxSearch is an extension to join any player in a server of a Roblox game.

General instructions:
1. Find a player you want to join. You must know in what game they are in.
2. Enter their username into the search field in the servers tab.
3. Click join when BloxSearch has found their server.

Instructions for Pls Donate:
1. Look for a player in the donation board.
2. Input their username in one of these places. The player could be in any of them:

(To prevent the extension being stuck on a search, I suggest searching first in places with less players. This is my suggested order: 1. +17, 2. Deluxe VC, 3. Legacy, 4. VC, 5. Main place)

3. If the player is either in the main place, the legacy map or the +17 place you can just click "Join". If the player was found in VC or Deluxe VC servers you must follow step 4 and 5.
4. (Only if the player was found in either VC or Deluxe VC servers): The search result will output a 32 character server ID. Save the first 8 characters for later, and take in consideration how many players are in the server.
5. Join a normal Pls Donate server and go to the server selector. There will be the list of all VC servers, each one associated to a server ID. The 8 characters you saved before must match with a server ID from the list. Find it and click join to join that server. You can take in consideration how many players are in the server to find the desired one faster.

Please note that if you can't find a player in any server it is because they're in a VIP server or you are making many requests at the same time.
